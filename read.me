1. functions.php
I added line 1 to line 7 and delete line 18 and 19 in header.php (for css links) but it does not work and I cannot figure out why.
<link href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />

2. inc/header.php
line 10 to line 36 is for navbar
I want to show menu and submenu but it shows error.
